        Builds package dependency chains i.e. groups of packages that must be delivered together.
        Once dependencies are resolved, the self._dependency_chain member is updated

        Big-O Analysis:
          O(N^2): Expansion/Resolution increases the search space to n * n
                  Every n item, must be compared to every n other item.
                  The worst case considers that every package is a dependency of every other.
          Average case is O(nâ€¢k):
            This considers that the number of dependencies is likely a lot smaller than the total search space, and
            the total package data set need only be iterated for the number of packages with dependencies or
            depended on by another.

        Example:
            Say we have the following subsets,
              where the first item in each set is the id of the package requiring the dependency:

              {1,2,3}, {5,3,4}, {20,21}, {23,20,21} {40,41}

        Core algorithm, which performs sorting packages onto trucks for the current set of trips.

        Worst Case:
          O(mâ€¢nâ€¢logn):
                Factors:
                    n items (packages) are iterated for updating the remaining queue
                    n items (packages) are sorted in the remaining queue to perform a priority queue
                    m items (loaded packages) per truck are iterated for updating the remaining queue
                Each item in the complete package data set is iterated by the number of trucks to build our list of
                remaining package. Since, m has some appropriate real world limit, and is guaranteed to include only
                some subset of n it should be negligible, but we include it anyways.
                (i.e. something like 1 truck per 1 package is insane, or 1 truck with all the packages is also insane).
                Once the list of remaining packages is formed, it gets sorted (nlogn) to form a priority queue.

                Since, we iterate our list twice (once with sort operations) this gives us O(n * logn).
                We don't perform any additional iterations for any item in n, so it doesn't grow exponentially.
                So, instead of 2n, for iterating it twice, we drop the constant.

                This leaves us with O(mâ€¢nâ€¢logn).

                        It makes sense to characterize this operation separately as m is therefore a tunable parameter,
                        and guaranteed to be less than n in our use case i.e. we can't have more packages loaded
                        than total packages than we have.
                        Thus, the worst case of this operation is O(m), where m is the number of trucks iterated.

                        Data Set Operations (complete):
                        Additionally, we consider building the list of remaining packages to be O(n).
                        Each package in the complete data set must be compared to the smaller subset of package ids
                        per loaded truck, by calling the 'in' operator ...

                        Therefore, in the worst case we are performing 16 comparisons per package in complete
                        list of all packages multiplied by the number of trucks.

                        Combining the worst case of each we end up with O(mâ€¢n).

        Core algorithm for controlling both loading and delivery of packages onboard trucks.

        Big-O Analysis:
          O(mâ€¢n^2â€¢logn):
            The combination of the runtime complexity of the load optimization algorithm,
            the path optimization algorithm, and the delivery algorithm.

            The load optimization is (mâ€¢nâ€¢logn), where m is # trucks and n is # packages
            The path optimization is (n^2â€¢logh), where h is the subset of n that forms the boundary (hull)
            The delivery algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of edges in the path visited

            We need to simplify the complexities somewhat to find a more easily understandable upper bound.
            One thing is the path optimization can be considered O(n^2) since the insertion sort inside it
            completely dwarfs the complexity to find the hull.

            Combining it we get: O(mâ€¢n^2â€¢logn), we can ignore the linear complexity of the delivery algorithm.

            With this, we know our algorithm is greater than n^2, but we don't think it's enough to call it
            n^3, since m, the number of truck operations performed is likely to be far smaller than n.

            That said, the combination of our algorithms has quite a bad runtime, but it beats out the time complexity
            to brute force the traveling salesperson problem, which would be O(n!).

            If we optimized our data structures further.
            One example, we could create layers to our convex hull algorithm, where we find successive convex hulls on
            the inner points within the boundary of the hull. Then, with a divide and conquer approach they could be
            merged to form the optimal path. With this kind of approach our solution should easily go to linearithmic
            time complexity.

        Complexity:
            O(n):
               number of edges in the path, by the number of packages in the truck

               For our purpose, since the truck capacity is fixed and small, we will consider package searches per
               edge iteration to be a constant time operation.

               The number of packages in the truck also reduces by 1 each edge iteration, reducing further iterations
               ( the linear sequence k(k-1), where k is truck capacity ).

        Creates a 'snapshot' for packages at the requested time.
